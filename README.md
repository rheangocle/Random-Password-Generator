# Random-Password-Generator

Module 3: Using Javascript to create a random password generator

In this activity, Javascript was used to create a random password generator. The code runs through a series of prompts to ask the user what they want to include in their new password. The first prompt asks the user the length of the new password (8-128). The rest of the prompts are about if the user wants to include at least one of these criteria: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers. The code will alert the user if the length input is invalid or if they did not choose at least one criteria. After this, the code will display the random password onto the screen.
